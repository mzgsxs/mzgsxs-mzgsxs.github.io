# A formal definition of intelligence by enviroment
Intelligence is diffcult to define, we have a rough idea of what it is, but was never able to define it precisly and accurately. Is it possible to define it? how accurate can we define it? By accurate, I mean to construct a theory and its corresponding model with a one to one mapping between it. Say, the concept of force is defined by Newton's classical mechanics theory, and the instantiation of the force is described by a model of a specfic senario, such as when moon is orbiting earth via gravity. And of course, qumtum mechanics is a more general theory with a definition of force.

In psychometrics, previoues attempt have used ideas such as Intelligence quotient, emotional quotient or social intelligence to quantify human intelligence. But of course intelligence in general is beyond human and many animals are more intelligent than humans in specific narratives. There has also been attempt to define intelligence by entropy, such as free energy principle. I believe intelligence should be defined by enviroment, related ideas [1][2] were proposed before, I will outline my attempt here.

## enviroment
Lets try to give a naive and incomplete definition of enviroment. Given a dynamical system, essential gradients are time(`T`), state space(`S`) and evolution function(e). Both time and state space can be either discrete or continoues. Define a action as it's influence to the evolution function, i.e `E -> E`, thus its an element of `{(e -> e'), e, e' evolution functions}`, 'no action' would be the element `(e -> e)`. Define fitness function as `f: Filteration_I, S -> {True, False} ???`. 


## classical and evolutionary game theory
Rock paper scissors


## category of dynamical systems


## category specific intelligence
With category theory, we can classify intelligence into hiearchies. Intelligence is defined as sets of enviroments.
